      "description": "You are given an integer array nums. A subsequence of nums is called a square streak if: The length of the subsequence is at least 2, and after sorting the subsequence, each element (except the first element) is the square of the previous number. Return the length of the longest square streak in nums, or return -1 if there is no square streak. A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: nums = [4,3,6,16,8,2] Output: 3 Explanation: Choose the subsequence [4,16,2]. After sorting it, it becomes [2,4,16]. - 4 = 2 * 2. - 16 = 4 * 4. Therefore, [4,16,2] is a square streak. It can be shown that every subsequence of length 4 is not a square streak.

If the ith marble and jth marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the ith and jth indices should also be in that same bag. If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from i to j inclusively, then the cost of the bag is weights[i] + weights[j].

The string t becomes &quot;baa&quot; which is a subsequence of the string &quot;abacaba&quot; and the score is 1 - 1 + 1 = 1. It can be proven that 1 is the minimum score that we can achieve. Example 2: Input: s = &quot;cde&quot;, t = &quot;xyz&quot; Output: 3 Explanation: In this example, we remove characters &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; at indices 0, 1, and 2 (0-indexed). The string t becomes &quot;&quot; which is a subsequence of the string &quot;cde&quot; and the score is 2 - 0 + 1 = 3.

Return the difference between the maximum and minimum&nbsp;values Bob can make by remapping&nbsp;exactly one digit in num. Notes: When Bob remaps a digit d1&nbsp;to another digit d2, Bob replaces all occurrences of d1&nbsp;in num&nbsp;with d2. Bob can remap a digit to itself, in which case num&nbsp;does not change. Bob can remap different digits for obtaining minimum and maximum values respectively.

Return an integer array answer with n results where the ith result is the minimum number of operations needed to bring the single 1 to position i in arr, or -1 if it is impossible. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: n = 4, p = 0, banned = [1,2], k = 4 Output: [0,-1,-1,1] Explanation: Initially 1 is placed at position 0 so the number of operations we need for position 0 is 0. We can never place 1 on the banned positions, so the answer for positions 1 and 2 is -1. Perform the operation of size 4 to reverse the whole array.

      "description": "Sometimes you have a long running task, and you may wish to cancel it before it completes. To help with this goal, write a function&nbsp;cancellable that accepts a generator object and returns an array of two values: a cancel function and a promise. You may assume the generator function will only&nbsp;yield promises. It is your function&#39;s responsibility to pass the values resolved by the promise back to the generator. If the promise rejects, your function should throw that&nbsp;error back to the generator. If the cancel callback is called before the generator is done, your function should throw an error back to the generator. That error should be the string&nbsp;&quot;Cancelled&quot;&nbsp;(Not an Error&nbsp;object). If the error was caught, the returned&nbsp;promise should resolve with the next value that was yielded or returned. Otherwise, the promise should reject with the thrown error. No more code should be executed. When the generator is done, the promise your function returned should resolve the value the generator returned. If, however, the generator throws an error, the returned promise should reject with the error. An example of how your code would be used: function* tasks() { const val = yield new Promise(resolve =&gt; resolve(2 + 2)); yield new Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, 100)); return val + 1; // calculation shouldn&#39;t be done. } const [cancel, promise] = cancellable(tasks()); setTimeout(cancel, 50); promise.catch(console.log); // logs &quot;Cancelled&quot; at t=50ms If&nbsp;instead&nbsp;cancel() was not called or was called after t=100ms, the promise would&nbsp;have resolved&nbsp;5. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { &nbsp; return 42; } cancelledAt = 100 Output: {&quot;resolved&quot;: 42} Explanation: const generator = generatorFunction(); const [cancel, promise] = cancellable(generator); setTimeout(cancel, 100); promise.then(console.log); // resolves 42 at t=0ms The generator immediately yields 42 and finishes. Because of that, the returned promise immediately resolves 42. Note that cancelling a finished generator does nothing. Example 2: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { &nbsp; const msg = yield new Promise(res =&gt; res(&quot;Hello&quot;)); &nbsp; throw `Error: ${msg}`; } cancelledAt = null Output: {&quot;rejected&quot;: &quot;Error: Hello&quot;} Explanation: A promise is yielded. The function handles this by waiting for it to resolve and then passes the resolved value back to the generator. Then an error is thrown which has the effect of causing the promise to reject with the same thrown error. Example 3: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { &nbsp; yield new Promise(res =&gt; setTimeout(res, 200)); &nbsp; return &quot;Success&quot;; } cancelledAt = 100 Output: {&quot;rejected&quot;: &quot;Cancelled&quot;} Explanation: While the function is waiting for the yielded promise to resolve, cancel() is called. This causes an error message to be sent back to the generator. Since this error is uncaught, the returned promise rejected with this error. Example 4: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { &nbsp; let result = 0; &nbsp; yield new Promise(res =&gt; setTimeout(res, 100)); &nbsp; result += yield new Promise(res =&gt; res(1)); &nbsp; yield new Promise(res =&gt; setTimeout(res, 100)); &nbsp; result += yield new Promise(res =&gt; res(1)); &nbsp; return result; } cancelledAt = null Output: {&quot;resolved&quot;: 2} Explanation: 4 promises are yielded. Two of those promises have their values added to the result. After 200ms, the generator finishes with a value of 2, and that value is resolved by the returned promise. Example 5: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { &nbsp; let result = 0; &nbsp; try { &nbsp; yield new Promise(res =&gt; setTimeout(res, 100)); &nbsp; result += yield new Promise(res =&gt; res(1)); &nbsp; yield new Promise(res =&gt; setTimeout(res, 100)); &nbsp; result += yield new Promise(res =&gt; res(1)); &nbsp; } catch(e) { &nbsp; return result; &nbsp; } &nbsp; return result; } cancelledAt = 150 Output: {&quot;resolved&quot;: 1} Explanation: The first two yielded promises resolve and cause the result to increment. However, at t=150ms, the generator is cancelled. The error sent to the generator is caught and the result is returned and finally resolved by the returned promise. Example 6: Input: generatorFunction = function*() { &nbsp; try { &nbsp; yield new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; reject(&quot;Promise Rejected&quot;)); &nbsp; } catch(e) { &nbsp; let a = yield new Promise(resolve =&gt; resolve(2)); let b = yield new Promise(resolve =&gt; resolve(2)); &nbsp; return a + b; &nbsp; }; } cancelledAt = null Output: {&quot;resolved&quot;: 4} Explanation: The first yielded promise immediately rejects. This error is caught. Because the generator hasn&#39;t been cancelled, execution continues as usual. It ends up resolving 2 + 2 = 4. &nbsp; Constraints: cancelledAt == null or 0 &lt;= cancelledAt &lt;= 1000 generatorFunction returns a generator object"

Note that the string concatenates after removing the substring and could produce new &quot;AB&quot; or &quot;CD&quot; substrings. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: s = &quot;ABFCACDB&quot; Output: 2 Explanation: We can do the following operations: - Remove the substring &quot;ABFCACDB&quot;, so s = &quot;FCACDB&quot;. - Remove the substring &quot;FCACDB&quot;, so s = &quot;FCAB&quot;. - Remove the substring &quot;FCAB&quot;, so s = &quot;FC&quot;. So the resulting length of the string is 2. It can be shown that it is the minimum length that we can obtain. Example 2: Input: s = &quot;ACBBD&quot; Output: 5 Explanation: We cannot do any operations on the string so the length remains the same. &nbsp; Constraints: 1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 100 s&nbsp;consists only of uppercase English letters."

The robots will move a unit distance each second. You are given a string s denoting the direction in which robots will move on command. &#39;L&#39; means the robot will move towards the left side or negative side of the number line, whereas &#39;R&#39; means the robot will move towards the right side or positive side of the number line. If two robots collide, they will start moving in opposite directions. Return the sum of distances between all the&nbsp;pairs of robots d seconds after&nbsp;the command. Since the sum can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7. Note: For two robots at the index i and j, pair (i,j) and pair (j,i) are considered the same pair. When robots collide, they instantly change their directions without wasting any time. Collision happens&nbsp;when two robots share the same place in a&nbsp;moment. For example, if a robot is positioned in 0 going to the right and another is positioned in 2 going to the left, the next second they&#39;ll be both in 1 and they will change direction and the next second the first one will be in 0, heading left, and another will be in 2, heading right. For example,&nbsp;if a robot is positioned in 0 going to the right and another is positioned in 1&nbsp;going to the left, the next second the first one will be in 0, heading left, and another will be in 1, heading right. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: nums = [-2,0,2], s = &quot;RLL&quot;, d = 3 Output: 8 Explanation: After 1 second, the positions are [-1,-1,1].

      "description": "You are given a 0-indexed array words containing n strings. Let&#39;s define a join operation join(x, y) between two strings x and y as concatenating them into xy. However, if the last character of x is equal to the first character of y, one of them is deleted. For example join(&quot;ab&quot;, &quot;ba&quot;) = &quot;aba&quot; and join(&quot;ab&quot;, &quot;cde&quot;) = &quot;abcde&quot;. You are to perform n - 1 join operations. Let str0 = words[0]. Starting from i = 1 up to i = n - 1, for the ith operation, you can do one of the following: Make stri = join(stri - 1, words[i]) Make stri = join(words[i], stri - 1) Your task is to minimize the length of strn - 1. Return an integer denoting the minimum possible length of strn - 1. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: words = [&quot;aa&quot;,&quot;ab&quot;,&quot;bc&quot;] Output: 4 Explanation: In this example, we can perform join operations in the following order to minimize the length of str2: str0 = &quot;aa&quot; str1 = join(str0, &quot;ab&quot;) = &quot;aab&quot; str2 = join(str1, &quot;bc&quot;) = &quot;aabc&quot; It can be shown that the minimum possible length of str2 is 4. Example 2: Input: words = [&quot;ab&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] Output: 2 Explanation: In this example, str0 = &quot;ab&quot;, there are two ways to get str1: join(str0, &quot;b&quot;) = &quot;ab&quot; or join(&quot;b&quot;, str0) = &quot;bab&quot;.

You are given 0-indexed integer arrays positions, healths, and a string directions (directions[i] is either &#39;L&#39; for left or &#39;R&#39; for right). All integers in positions are unique. All robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide. If two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot decreases by one. The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going. If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line. Your task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order that the robots were given, i.e. final health of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on.

Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4&#39;s health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3&#39;s health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].

Your task is to find the maximum elegance from all subsequences of size k in items. Return an integer denoting the maximum elegance of a subsequence of items with size exactly k.

You have to maximize your score by applying the following operation at most k times: Choose any non-empty subarray nums[l, ..., r] that you haven&#39;t chosen previously. Choose an element x of nums[l, ..., r] with the highest prime score. If multiple such elements exist, choose the one with the smallest index. Multiply your score by x. Here, nums[l, ..., r] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index l and ending at the index r, both ends being inclusive. The prime score of an integer x is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of x. For example, the prime score of 300 is 3 since 300 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5. Return the maximum possible score after applying at most k operations. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: nums = [8,3,9,3,8], k = 2 Output: 81 Explanation: To get a score of 81, we can apply the following operations: - Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 2]. nums[2] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 1 * 9 = 9. - Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 1, but nums[2] has the smaller index.

Hence, we multiply the score by nums[0]. The score becomes 1 * 19 = 19. - Choose subarray nums[5, ..., 5]. nums[5] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[5].

After these operations, all the edges in the path from 0 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 3.

We need to find for each -1 the respective positive integer, which we call the last visited integer. To achieve this goal, let&#39;s define two empty arrays: seen and ans. Start iterating from the beginning of the array nums. If a positive integer is encountered, prepend it to the front of seen. If -1&nbsp;is encountered, let k be the number of consecutive -1s seen so far (including the current -1), If k is less than or equal to the length of seen, append the k-th element of seen to ans. If k is strictly greater than the length of seen, append -1 to ans. Return the array ans. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: nums = [1,2,-1,-1,-1] Output: [2,1,-1] Explanation: Start with seen = [] and ans = []. Process nums[0]: The first element in nums is 1. We prepend it to the front of seen. Now, seen == [1]. Process nums[1]: The next element is 2. We prepend it to the front of seen. Now, seen == [2, 1]. Process nums[2]: The next element is -1.

      "description": "You are given a string array words, and an array groups, both arrays having length n. The hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different. You need to select the longest subsequence from an array of indices [0, 1, ..., n - 1], such that for the subsequence denoted as [i0, i1, ..., ik-1] having length k, the following holds: For adjacent indices in the subsequence, their corresponding groups are unequal, i.e., groups[ij] != groups[ij+1], for each j where 0 &lt; j + 1 &lt; k. words[ij] and words[ij+1] are equal in length, and the hamming distance between them is 1, where 0 &lt; j + 1 &lt; k, for all indices in the subsequence. Return a string array containing the words corresponding to the indices (in order) in the selected subsequence. If there are multiple answers, return any of them. Note: strings in words may be unequal in length. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: words = [&quot;bab&quot;,&quot;dab&quot;,&quot;cab&quot;], groups = [1,2,2] Output: [&quot;bab&quot;,&quot;cab&quot;] Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is [0,2]. groups[0] != groups[2] words[0].length == words[2].length, and the hamming distance between them is 1. So, a valid answer is [words[0],words[2]] = [&quot;bab&quot;,&quot;cab&quot;]. Another subsequence that can be selected is [0,1]. groups[0] != groups[1] words[0].length == words[1].length, and the hamming distance between them is 1. So, another valid answer is [words[0],words[1]] = [&quot;bab&quot;,&quot;dab&quot;]. It can be shown that the length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the conditions is 2. Example 2: Input: words = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;], groups = [1,2,3,4] Output: [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;] Explanation: We can select the subsequence [0,1,2,3].

      "description": "Given a string s and an integer k, partition s into k substrings such that the letter changes needed to make each substring a semi-palindrome&nbsp;are minimized. Return the minimum number of letter changes required. A semi-palindrome is a special type of string that can be divided into palindromes based on a repeating pattern. To check if a string is a semi-palindrome:​ Choose a positive divisor d of the string&#39;s length. d can range from 1 up to, but not including, the string&#39;s length. For a string of length 1, it does not have a valid divisor as per this definition, since the only divisor is its length, which is not allowed. For a given divisor d, divide the string into groups where each group contains characters from the string that follow a repeating pattern of length d. Specifically, the first group consists of characters at positions 1, 1 + d, 1 + 2d, and so on; the second group includes characters at positions 2, 2 + d, 2 + 2d, etc. The string is considered a semi-palindrome if each of these groups forms a palindrome. Consider the string &quot;abcabc&quot;: The length of &quot;abcabc&quot; is 6. Valid divisors are 1, 2, and 3. For d = 1: The entire string &quot;abcabc&quot; forms one group. Not a palindrome. For d = 2: Group 1 (positions 1, 3, 5): &quot;acb&quot; Group 2 (positions 2, 4, 6): &quot;bac&quot; Neither group forms a palindrome. For d = 3: Group 1 (positions 1, 4): &quot;aa&quot; Group 2 (positions 2, 5): &quot;bb&quot; Group 3 (positions 3, 6): &quot;cc&quot; All groups form palindromes. Therefore, &quot;abcabc&quot; is a semi-palindrome. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: s = &quot;abcac&quot;, k = 2 Output: 1 Explanation: Divide s into &quot;ab&quot; and &quot;cac&quot;. &quot;cac&quot; is already semi-palindrome.

Each shop has n items where the jth item in the ith shop has a value of values[i][j]. Additionally, the items in the ith shop are sorted in non-increasing order of value. That is, values[i][j] &gt;= values[i][j + 1] for all 0 &lt;= j &lt; n - 1. On each day, you would like to buy a single item from one of the shops. Specifically, On the dth day you can: Pick any shop i. Buy the rightmost available item j for the price of values[i][j] * d. That is, find the greatest index j such that item j was never bought before, and buy it for the price of values[i][j] * d. Note that all items are pairwise different. For example, if you have bought item 0 from shop 1, you can still buy item 0 from any other shop. Return the maximum amount of money that can be spent on buying all m * n products. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: values = [[8,5,2],[6,4,1],[9,7,3]] Output: 285 Explanation: On the first day, we buy product 2 from shop 1 for a price of values[1][2] * 1 = 1.

You can perform any number of operations, where each operation involves selecting a subarray of the array and replacing it with the sum of its elements. For example, if the given array is [1,3,5,6] and you select subarray [3,5] the array will convert to [1,8,6]. Return the maximum length of a non-decreasing array that can be made after applying operations. A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: nums = [5,2,2] Output: 1 Explanation: This array with length 3 is not non-decreasing. We have two ways to make the array length two. First, choosing subarray [2,2] converts the array to [5,4]. Second, choosing subarray [5,2] converts the array to [7,2]. In these two ways the array is not non-decreasing. And if we choose subarray [5,2,2] and replace it with [9] it becomes non-decreasing. So the answer is 1.

The company has realized that they are spending an excessive amount of time traveling between their branches. As a result, they have decided to close down some of these branches (possibly none). However, they want to ensure that the remaining branches have a distance of at most maxDistance from each other. The distance between two branches is the minimum total traveled length needed to reach one branch from another. You are given integers n, maxDistance, and a 0-indexed 2D array roads, where roads[i] = [ui, vi, wi] represents the undirected road between branches ui and vi with length wi. Return the number of possible sets of closing branches, so that any branch has a distance of at most maxDistance from any other.

You are also given a 0-indexed integer array cost of length n, where cost[i] is the cost assigned to the ith node. You need to place some coins on every node of the tree. The number of coins to be placed at node i can be calculated as: If size of the subtree of node i is less than 3, place 1 coin. Otherwise, place an amount of coins equal to the maximum product of cost values assigned to 3 distinct nodes in the subtree of node i. If this product is negative, place 0 coins.

      "description": "You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n, and two positive integers k and dist. The cost of an array is the value of its first element. For example, the cost of [1,2,3] is 1 while the cost of [3,4,1] is 3. You need to divide nums into k disjoint contiguous subarrays, such that the difference between the starting index of the second subarray and the starting index of the kth subarray should be less than or equal to dist. In other words, if you divide nums into the subarrays nums[0..(i1 - 1)], nums[i1..(i2 - 1)], ..., nums[ik-1..(n - 1)], then ik-1 - i1 &lt;= dist. Return the minimum possible sum of the cost of these subarrays. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: nums = [1,3,2,6,4,2], k = 3, dist = 3 Output: 5 Explanation: The best possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays is: [1,3], [2,6,4], and [2]. This choice is valid because ik-1 - i1 is 5 - 2 = 3 which is equal to dist. The total cost is nums[0] + nums[2] + nums[5] which is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. It can be shown that there is no possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays at a cost lower than 5. Example 2: Input: nums = [10,1,2,2,2,1], k = 4, dist = 3 Output: 15 Explanation: The best possible way to divide nums into 4 subarrays is: [10], [1], [2], and [2,2,1]. This choice is valid because ik-1 - i1 is 3 - 1 = 2 which is less than dist. The total cost is nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[3] which is 10 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 15. The division [10], [1], [2,2,2], and [1] is not valid, because the difference between ik-1 and i1 is 5 - 1 = 4, which is greater than dist.

Similarly, we define the up direction as positive y-axis (increasing y-coordinate) and the down direction as negative y-axis (decreasing y-coordinate) You have to place n people, including Alice and Bob, at these points such that there is exactly one person at every point.

      "description": "You are given m x n grid image which represents a grayscale image, where image[i][j] represents a pixel with intensity in the range [0..255]. You are also given a non-negative integer threshold. Two pixels are adjacent if they share an edge. A region is a 3 x 3 subgrid where the absolute difference in intensity between any two adjacent pixels is less than or equal to threshold. All pixels in a region belong to that region, note that a pixel can belong to multiple regions. You need to calculate a m x n grid result, where result[i][j] is the average intensity of the regions to which image[i][j] belongs, rounded down to the nearest integer. If image[i][j] belongs to multiple regions, result[i][j] is the average of the rounded-down average intensities of these regions, rounded down to the nearest integer. If image[i][j] does not belong to any region, result[i][j] is equal to image[i][j]. Return the grid result. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: image = [[5,6,7,10],[8,9,10,10],[11,12,13,10]], threshold = 3 Output: [[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9]] Explanation: There are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first region is 9, while the average intensity of the second region is 9.67 which is rounded down to 9. The average intensity of both of the regions is (9 + 9) / 2 = 9. As all the pixels belong to either region 1, region 2, or both of them, the intensity of every pixel in the result is 9. Please note that the rounded-down values are used when calculating the average of multiple regions, hence the calculation is done using 9 as the average intensity of region 2, not 9.67. Example 2: Input: image = [[10,20,30],[15,25,35],[20,30,40],[25,35,45]], threshold = 12 Output: [[25,25,25],[27,27,27],[27,27,27],[30,30,30]] Explanation: There are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first region is 25, while the average intensity of the second region is 30. The average intensity of both of the regions is (25 + 30) / 2 = 27.5 which is rounded down to 27. All the pixels in row 0 of the image belong to region 1, hence all the pixels in row 0 in the result are 25. Similarly, all the pixels in row 3 in the result are 30. The pixels in rows 1 and 2 of the image belong to region 1 and region 2, hence their assigned value is 27 in the result. Example 3: Input: image = [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]], threshold = 1 Output: [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]] Explanation: There is only one 3 x 3 subgrid, while it does not have the condition on difference of adjacent pixels, for example, the difference between image[0][0] and image[1][0] is |5 - 8| = 3 &gt; threshold = 1. None of them belong to any valid regions, so the result should be the same as image. &nbsp; Constraints: 3 &lt;= n, m &lt;= 500 0 &lt;= image[i][j] &lt;= 255 0 &lt;= threshold &lt;= 255"

      "description": "You are given two 1-indexed integer arrays, nums and, changeIndices, having lengths n and m, respectively. Initially, all indices in nums are unmarked. Your task is to mark all indices in nums. In each second, s, in order from 1 to m (inclusive), you can perform one of the following operations: Choose an index i in the range [1, n] and decrement nums[i] by 1. Set nums[changeIndices[s]] to any non-negative value. Choose an index i in the range [1, n], where nums[i] is equal to 0, and mark index i. Do nothing. Return an integer denoting the earliest second in the range [1, m] when all indices in nums can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or -1 if it is impossible. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: nums = [3,2,3], changeIndices = [1,3,2,2,2,2,3] Output: 6 Explanation: In this example, we have 7 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices: Second 1: Set nums[changeIndices[1]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,3]. Second 2: Set nums[changeIndices[2]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,0]. Second 3: Set nums[changeIndices[3]] to 0. nums becomes [0,0,0]. Second 4: Mark index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0. Second 5: Mark index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0. Second 6: Mark index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0. Now all indices have been marked. It can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 6th second. Hence, the answer is 6. Example 2: Input: nums = [0,0,1,2], changeIndices = [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2] Output: 7 Explanation: In this example, we have 8 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices: Second 1: Mark index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0. Second 2: Mark index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0. Second 3: Decrement index 4 by one. nums becomes [0,0,1,1]. Second 4: Decrement index 4 by one. nums becomes [0,0,1,0]. Second 5: Decrement index 3 by one. nums becomes [0,0,0,0]. Second 6: Mark index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0. Second 7: Mark index 4, since nums[4] is equal to 0. Now all indices have been marked.

Example 3: Input: nums = [1,2,3], changeIndices = [1,2,3] Output: -1 Explanation: In this example, it can be shown that it is impossible to mark all indices, as we don&#39;t have enough seconds.

For example: To reduce the height of the mountain by 1, it takes workerTimes[i] seconds. To reduce the height of the mountain by 2, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 seconds, and so on. Return an integer representing the minimum number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain 0. &nbsp; Example 1: Input: mountainHeight = 4, workerTimes = [2,1,1] Output: 3 Explanation: One way the height of the mountain can be reduced to 0 is: Worker 0 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[0] = 2 seconds. Worker 1 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 = 3 seconds. Worker 2 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[2] = 1 second.

Example 2: Input: mountainHeight = 10, workerTimes = [3,2,2,4] Output: 12 Explanation: Worker 0 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 = 9 seconds. Worker 1 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 + workerTimes[1] * 3 = 12 seconds.

You are also given a string s of length n, where s[i] is the character assigned to node i. Consider an empty string dfsStr, and define a recursive function dfs(int x) that takes a node x as a parameter and performs the following steps in order: Iterate over each child y of x in increasing order of their numbers, and call dfs(y). Add the character s[x] to the end of the string dfsStr. Note that dfsStr is shared across all recursive calls of dfs. You need to find a boolean array answer of size n, where for each index i from 0 to n - 1, you do the following: Empty the string dfsStr and call dfs(i).

If s[i] == &#39;a&#39;, you should replace it with &#39;z&#39;. This operation costs previousCost[j] where j is the index of s[i] in the alphabet.

The x-value of nums for a given x is defined as the number of ways to perform this operation so that the product of the remaining elements leaves a remainder of x modulo k.
